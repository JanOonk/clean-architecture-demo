# Clean Architecture Demo
A sample application for <a href="https://goo.gl/rJpHLb" target="_blank">Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices, and Principles</a>

This sample application is intended to be a learning tool for clean architecture practices. It incorporates several of these practices in a way that is simple and easy to understand.

To run the sample application create an empty database for example *CleanArchitecture* and update the connection string in `Web.config` from the Presentation project.
